# `cat-server`

![Banner](res/banner.png)

`cat-server` is a Java tool, based on [CAT](https://github.com/IdrissRio/cat/), that constructs call graphs based on Class Hierarchy Analaysis and a variant of Rapid Type Analysis. It uses JastAdd and reference attribute grammars for its implementation. `cat-server` acts as a back-end for [`cat-viz`](https://github.com/trettiofem/cat-viz), an extension for Visual Studio Code, which displays call graphs, right in the editor.
